When learning Japanese language, I encountered some unique properties in the language — **Yojijukugo** (四字熟語). I admire it as an art of the language, as it's limited for only 4 kanji to convey a meaning. Sometimes, I took note of Yojijukugo that I found. Here's a few Yojijukugo that I noted throughout my learning:

####  1. 四字熟語 (よじじゅくご/Yojijukugo)
The word **Yojijukugo** itself is a Yojijukugo. Pretty cool.

####  2. 一所懸命 (いっしょけんめい/Isshokenmei)
It means **with utmost effort**. I learned this while studying for JLPT N4.

####  3. 単純明快 (たんじゅんめいかい/Tanjunmeikai)
It means **simple and clear**. We can separate this into two words: 単純(たんじゅん/Tanjun/Simple) and 明快(めいかい/Meikai/Clear).

####  4. 拍手喝采 (はくしゅかっさい/Hakushuukassai)
It means **clap and cheering**. I found this while reading the lyrics of **Eve - Fight Song**.

####  5. 薄利多売 (はくりたばい/Hakuritabai)
It means **small profits and quick returns**. I found this while reading the lyrics of **Yunomi - ロボティックガール**.

####  6. 無理難題 (むりなんだい/Murinandai)
It means **unreasonable demand**. I also found this while reading lyrics! It's the lyrics of **sugar sweet nightmare**. There's one more of Yojijukugo in this song, but that's too specific and I can't read the kanji components at all.

####  7. 起承転結 (きしょうてんけつ/Kishoutenketsu)
It means **introduction, development, turn and conclusion**. It fits all from beginning to ending!.. I also discovered this from lyrics of **Los! Los! Los!**.

####  8. 喜怒哀楽 (きどあいらく/Kidoairaku)
It means **human emotions** (joy, anger, grief and pleasure). If you can read the components, it's all included: 喜 (joy), 怒 (anger), 哀 (sadness), 楽 (comfort/ease).

####  9. 不協和音 (ふきょうわおん/Fukyouwaon)
It means **disharmony**. May be short in English, but in kanji it says "not cooperating chord".

####  10. 私利私欲 (しりしよく/Shirishiyoku)
It means **self-interest/greed**. Found in the lyrics of **Itadaki Babel**.

As you can see, most of the Yojijukugo I found are in song lyrics. If you are learning Japanese and want to find them too, try reading some of your favorite song lyrics!
